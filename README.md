# Halftoner
Convert a JPG into a "halftone-like" SVG file suitable for laser-cutting

# Background
Back in the old days, when print-makers often had only monochromatic ink, a variety of ways were
devised for conveying a detailed image with just that one color and the color of the surface upon which
the print was made.  Some of those techniques are can be used (sometimes with minor modification)
for converting images into patterns for laser-cutting out of surfaces.

This particular program uses one of two techniques, both variants on traditional halftoning.

# Options
Simple use:

`$ halftoner.php -s [source image]`

# The Code
Oh, don't look to closely at that. It's written badly and in the wrong language. The End was the focus, not
the Means.
